## Ethereum?
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It operates on a blockchain, ensuring:

- Transparency: All transactions are visible and verifiable on the blockchain.
- Security: The blockchain is resistant to tampering and fraud.
- Immutability: Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.

## Solidity
Solidity is a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is:

- Statically-Typed: The type of variables is known at compile time.
- Object-Oriented: It supports features like inheritance, libraries, and user-defined types.
- Specifically Designed: For writing smart contracts that run on the EVM.
By learning Solidity, you'll be able to create smart contracts that automate, verify, and enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract on the Ethereum network.
