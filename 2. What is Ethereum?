## Ethereum?
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It operates on a blockchain, ensuring:

- Transparency: All transactions are visible and verifiable on the blockchain.
- Security: The blockchain is resistant to tampering and fraud.
- Immutability: Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.

## Solidity
Solidity is a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is:

- Statically-Typed: The type of variables is known at compile time.
- Object-Oriented: It supports features like inheritance, libraries, and user-defined types.
- Specifically Designed: For writing smart contracts that run on the EVM.
By learning Solidity, you'll be able to create smart contracts that automate, verify, and enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract on the Ethereum network.

## Setting up a Development Environment
To start building your voting dApp, we need to set up our development environment. Here's what you'll need:

### Tools Required:
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
- npm: Node package manager.
- Truffle: Ethereum development framework.
- Ganache: Local blockchain for testing.
- MetaMask: Ethereum wallet browser extension.
#### Step-by-Step Setup:
- Install Node.js and npm:

Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org. This will also install npm.
- Install Truffle:

Open your terminal and run:
```
npm install -g truffle
```
- Install Ganache:

Download and install Ganache from trufflesuite.com/ganache.
- Install MetaMask:

Add the MetaMask extension to your browser from metamask.io.
